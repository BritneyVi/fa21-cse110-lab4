1. It prints out the value of i, the total number of prices that were discounted, in this case 3
2. It prints out the last value of the variable discountedPrice, in this case 150 
3. It prints out 150
4. [50, 100, 150]
5. There is an error because due to the nature of let, using let to declare i means it is only defined within the scope of the loop and therefore is not valid outside of it. 
6. There is an error because due to the nature of let, using let to declare discountedPrice means it is only defined within the scope of the loop and therefore is not valid outside of it. 
7. It outputs 150 because final price was not assigned by using let meaning its value exists beyond the scope of the for loop
8. It outputs [50, 100, 150] because even though we used let to define the value of discounted since it is declared in the scope of the whole function, it can still return the value even after exiting the for loop because it is still in scope.
9.  There was an error because we cannot assign anything to a variable that is a constant 
10. It returns an error even though the length should be 3, the 
11. It returns an error
12. A) student.name

    B) student['Grad year']

    C) student.greeting()

    D) student["Favorite Teacher].name 

    E) student.courseLoad[0]
13. A)  32 because using '3' + 2 will map the integer to its exact string representation 
    
    B)  1 because the string value of '3' is converted to its normal int value

    C)  3 because null becomes zero 

    D)  3null because null becomes a string to match with the '3'

    E)  4 because true becomes the value one

    F)  0 because false becomes zero and null becomes zero 

    G)  3undefined it treats both as strings because of the '' around 3 

    H)  NaN, Undefined becomes 'NaN' and when you subtract any number by NaN then it also becomes NaN, and so NaN - NaN is NaN

14. A) true, because the value 2 becomes an integer and it is true that 2 is larger than 1
    
    B) false, the string length of 2 is less than 12 

    C) true, the int value of 2 is equal to the int value of 2, and '2' became 2 because == does type conversion

    D) false, the datatype of '2' is not converted to the int value because of the use of ===

    E) False, true is equal to 1 which is not question to two

    F) True, Boolean(2) is equal to true because it is not zero and true is equal to true. 
15. == supports type conversion while === does not

17. [2, 4, 6] The modifying function creates an array and pushes numbers into it. The function doSomething multiplies the numbers passed by 2.
